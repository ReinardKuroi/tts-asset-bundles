# tts-asset-bundles

#### hello there
 
Just a little something to make building asset bundles easier. Was made for a kitchen sink project to avoid rebuilding every single asset every time.

Could probably use some improvements but it works.

#### how to use

 - Select your prefabs and assign an asset bundle to them (bottom right when you select a prefab, right down the road, can't miss it)
 - Right-click in the asset window, or navigate to `Menu -> Assets -> Manage Asset Bundles`
 - Select desired bundles
 - Build them
 - Profit
 - Alternatively, there is a delete button that makes it much easier to remove unwanted asset bundles from the project (this does not affect the final .unity3d files)

#### potential impovements

 - Actual windows explorer popup for `Save to:` instead of an input field
 - Render tree structure for checkbox scrollview based on asset bundle naming scheme (split on `/` or smth, it's a chore to make in `EditorGUILayout`)

#### cheers

Have a fantastic day
